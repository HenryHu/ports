sane-airscan -- Linux support of Apple AirScan (eSCL) compatible document
scanners

If you are a lucky owner of scanner or MFP which works via network with Apple
devices, I have a good news for you: now your scanner works with Linux as well!

In theory, this backend should work with any scanner that supports the eSCL
protocol (unofficially known as AirScan or AirPrint scanning). In practice, it
was tested on several devices from Canon, Kyocera and HP, and this list
constantly grows, though slowly, so feedback regarding other devices is very
welcomed.

Apple maintains a comprehensive list of compatible devices, but please note,
this list contains not only scanners and MFP, but pure printers as well.

To use this backend, you don't need to install ScanGear from Canon, HPLIP from
HP or some other proprietary software from hardware vendor. This backend works
directly with your device and doesn't depend on a 3rd party closed source
components.
