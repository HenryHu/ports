The workflow of importing a new version is:

1. update Makefile's DISTVERSION to new version
2. check Telegram/ThirdParty and update Makefile
3. make makesum
4. sync files/CMakeLists.inj with Arch's version
5. create a new branch from last patched branch
6. git fetch upstream && git pull upstream <new version tag>
7. resolve conflicts & git commit
8. git diff <new version tag>..HEAD > new_patch
9. remove old patches
10. make extract
11. apply new_patch
12. make makepatch
13. test & fix problems. repeat steps 8..12

Steps 8..12 are implemented in sync-patch.sh. To use it, version numbers must
be filled in. Step 4 has to be done for both tdesktop and libtgvoip. For
libtgvoip, the version tag may be "tdesktop".
