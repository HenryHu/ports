The workflow of importing a new version is:

1. create a new branch from last patched branch
2. git fetch upstream && git pull upstream <new version tag>
3. resolve conflicts & git commit
4. git diff <new version tag>..HEAD > new_patch
5. remove old patches
6. make extract
7. apply new_patch
8. make makepatch
9. test & fix problems. repeat steps 4..8

Steps 4..8 are implemented in sync-patch.sh
